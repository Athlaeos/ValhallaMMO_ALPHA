The old configuration is a collection of config files used when the old crafting system was still used.

This old crafting system required players to shift-right click certain blocks, select a recipe, and then
hold right click on that block for some amount of time to craft or improve upon an item.
It was an immersive system which could be fun for roleplay-type servers, but was for many players confusing as
the types of blocks were quite arbitarary, there was no recipe book to look at what was available, and certain
processes were quite annoying to perform repeatedly.

If you still prefer this system though, simply copy the files from this old_configuration folder and paste them in the
ValhallaMMO folder. Replace any files that are already there.
The server should be offline while this is done, and this should also preferably be done before before any players have
made significant progress with the plugin. Players who do have some progress made should receive a soft reset, a reset
that returns their exp afterwards so they don't lose progress, so that any off-stats could be corrected.
