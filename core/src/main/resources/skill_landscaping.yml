tree_capitator_instant: true # If true, tree capitator breaks trees instantly
break_limit_tree_capitator: 128 # Maximum amount of blocks the Ultra Harvesting special ability is allowed to break
leaf_decay_limit_tree_capitator: 384 # The max amount of leaves tree capitator will attempt to decay after treecapitator. If 0, this is disabled

forgiving_multipliers: true # drop multipliers below 0 will, if false, sometimes cause blocks mined to not drop anything.
# if true, the drop amount can not go below 1 so only blocks that drop multiple items (such as redstone ore, lapis lazuli ore,
# gold/iron ore with fortune) will be affected, but everything else will drop at least 1.
# This may be set to false if you desire a more grindy experience for your players, though it might be frustrating for them
