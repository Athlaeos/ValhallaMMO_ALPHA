vein_mining_instant: false # If true, vein mining breaks blocks instantly

forgiving_multipliers: true # drop multipliers below 0 will, if false, sometimes cause blocks mined to not drop anything.
# if true, the drop amount can not go below 1 so only blocks that drop multiple items (such as redstone ore, lapis lazuli ore,
# gold/iron ore with fortune) will be affected, but everything else will drop at least 1.
# This may be set to false if you desire a more grindy experience for your players, though it might be frustrating for them

remove_tnt_chaining: true # if true, tnt will no longer be able to detonate other tnt. instead, tnt that otherwise would be
# detonated drops as an item. Recommended to keep enabled for public servers

cosmetic_outline: false # If true, vein miner-mined blocks get a cool particle outline when they break
# this has no functionality, I just think it looks cool. probably not great for performance though idk
outline_color: '#ff0000' # The color the particle outline should have (this is red :) )

quickmode_block_values: # Values of blocks with the quick mining mode enabled, the blocks here count for more
  # points than usual. unlisted blocks are defined as being worth 1. The more worth a block, the quicker the player loses
  # saturation, hunger, or health when quick mining them.
  # This ability also only works on blocks that give the player experience when mined (defined in progression_mining.yml)
