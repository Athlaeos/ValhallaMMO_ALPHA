# If the database credentials are wrong or absent, the plugin will use PersistentDataContainer to store profiles.
# This means profiles can't be viewed as a whole, only individually, and also can't be edited without using
# plugin-provided commands. The plugin will also have to use work-arounds to make leaderboards work by temporarily
# storing certain datapoints in another file (leaderboards.yml).

# GAMEPLAY

# Items may be given a property that prevents/punishes players for using equipment that is too far above their own skill
# level. Example: if a level 0 light weapons player uses a 250 quality netherite sword before level x its effect will be
# greatly reduced
# The following formula outputs a multiplier that's applied on the given penalties with the purpose to reduce the
# penalty the closer the player gets to the intended usage level, and remove them once they've reached it.
# By default, this formula roughly gives the full penalty until the player has reached half the intended level, then it
# starts reducing more rapidly. At 90%, this penalty is halved. At 96% it's a quarter, at 98% an eighth.
# %fraction_level% is equal to PLAYERLEVEL / INTENDEDLEVEL, so if an item's intended level is 70 but the player is only
# level 35, this will be 0.5.
# Example: a netherite sword is configured to "require" light weapons level 80 to be used properly, the player is only
# light weapons level 60 so the player is 75% of the way there. The formula with this number outputs 0.9, so the player's
# damage is (-0.7 * 0.9) = -0.63 = 63% weaker
# To make this formula less severe I recommend decreasing the exponent (^8) to a lower positive number
# The output of this formula can never exceed 1 or go below 0

# COMBAT & DAMAGE

# This affects the "velocity damage multiplier" mechanics specifically
# The given number is what the entity's velocity is being divided by to determine bonus damage
# So if an entity gets +10% velocity bonus damage, and their travel velocity is 0.5, having this value set at 0.1 would
# equate to 0.5/0.1 = 5, 5 * 10% = 50% extra damage.

# Damage calculation for armor and armor toughness. Armor is effective only against the given damage sources,

# Valid arguments are %damage%, %toughness%, and %armor%
# This default formula doubles the player's effective HP every 10 armor points, or up to 6x eHP at 50 armor,
# and further reduces heavy damage with toughness. Toughness is not very effective if the player doesn't have
# a lot of armor or if the player doesn't take very heavy damage. This formula normally breaks at extreme damage numbers,
# but damage reduction cannot go below a certain fraction to make sure the formula can never go into the negatives
