  # The area under this graph from point a to point b represents the total amount of experience needed to get from level
  # a to b. You don't have to work with this, it's only for those who really want to make this progression their own.
  # By default, it takes about 4300 exp to get from 0 to 20, 27,000 to get from 20 to 40, 164,000 from 40 to 60,
  # 1,000,000 from 60 to 80, and 6,300,000 from 80 to 100- or 7,500,000 from 0 to 100.

  distance_exp_multiplier: 0.75 # fraction of additional exp gained per 10 blocks of distance between you and the target
  # example: if you're 50 blocks away from a target you shot with a bow you gain 0.25 * 80 exp
  # plus an additional (0.75 * 5) x 80 exp resulting in 320 exp gained from that shot
  distance_limit: 100 # the distance cap to this exp multiplier, since it would otherwise be possible to shoot at an
  # entity and teleport hundreds of thousands of blocks away before the arrow hits to gain an absurd amount of exp
  # from a single arrow. By default this cap is 100, or a max of 6x exp
