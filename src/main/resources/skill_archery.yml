# The distance between shooter and target can increase the damage on an arrow, but to prevent this from being exploited
# to one-shot targets there's a limit to how far this damage can go.
# The damage increase is not predefined in configs, it is determined in the player's profile
# Distances beyond this amount will not affect the damage of shots further
distance_limit: 50

prevent_crits_facing_shooter: true # If enabled, no matter what, the shooter will never be able to stun if the shot enemy is facing the shooter
facing_angle: 70 # The angle between the target's line of vision and to the shooter which the plugin would consider
# the target to be "facing" the shooter, the effective angle of vision is double this value.
# example: if this value is 90, the shooter can be anywhere within 180 degrees in front of the target for the target to
# "see" the shooter. Anywhere outside of that front 180 degrees will be considered "facing away"
